# Connect 4 AI – Minimax Algorithm

An AI-powered Connect 4 game where you can play against an intelligent opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- 🎮 **Play Against AI** – Compete against an intelligent agent that makes optimal moves.
- 🧠 **Minimax Algorithm** – Implements classic Minimax for turn-based strategy.
- 🧩 **Win Detection** – Efficient logic to check for victory conditions in all directions.
- ⚙️ **Adjustable Depth** – Configure the search depth to increase or decrease AI difficulty.
- 🧪 **Well-Structured Code** – Modular design for easy extension or GUI integration.

## How It Works

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate game states and select the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances.

## Future Improvements

Right now I am in the process of converting the code from Java and Swing to Python and React!
